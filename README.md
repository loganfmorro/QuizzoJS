# QuizzoJS

The goal of this application is to complete the JavaScript Quiz in a certain time frime and get as many answers right as possible. If the user gets an answer wrong, it will lower their score by 10. At the end, the user should be able to store their initials and show a list of high scores. (I was unable to get this function working properly, but the code is in place)

I struggled to get some of the requirements done, such as localstorage storing the scores and then outputting them. I also had an issue with the results page itself. I'm confident I would have figured this out over time, but unfortunately ran out of it.
